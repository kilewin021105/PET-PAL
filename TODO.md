# TODO for Changing Pet Picture Edit to Avatars

- [x] Define a list of predefined avatar URLs in the _PetProfileScreenState class.
- [x] Modify the _promptAddPhoto method to display an AlertDialog with a GridView of avatar images instead of opening the gallery.
- [x] Handle avatar selection: update the pet's photo_url in the database and refresh the UI.
