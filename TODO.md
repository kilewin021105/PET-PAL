# TODO: Adjust Logo Size and Screen Layout in Login Form

- [x] Resize the logo (Image.asset('assets/PETPAL.png')) to smaller dimensions (e.g., width: 100, height: 100) to make it less prominent.
- [x] Move logo to app bar in login screen.
- [x] Reorder login form: logo, Sign In button, email field, password field.
- [ ] Wrap the body content in SingleChildScrollView to allow scrolling and prevent overflow warnings when the keyboard appears during typing.
